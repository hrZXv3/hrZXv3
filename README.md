 HI I'M ELIJAH (hrZXv3)

- Aspiring to specialize in: Social Engineering • Offensive Security (Red Team) • Fraud Simulation

🚀 About Me

- 🎯 Goal: work toward specialization in social engineering and fraud simulation to understand attacks deeply and learn how to defend against them.

- 🧪 All experiments are done in isolated labs (VMs / closed networks) and always with explicit authorization for any simulation.

- 🧰 Tools & tech: Python, Flask, Bash, Kali, Burp Suite, OSINT tools, Docker, GitHub Actions.

🔒 Ethics & Legal Framework

- Everything I build or experiment with is educational and performed in controlled environments only. I never encourage or perform real-world fraud or social engineering against unauthorized targets. Offensive security without formal written authorization is illegal. My work aims to improve awareness, defense, and detection.

📌 Highlighted Projects 

- Phishing Lab (Flask) — simulated login portal for training and analysis (JSONL captures, not versioned).

- OpenCompanyScout — an OSINT-focused tool that aggregates publicly available company data to assist in corporate footprint analysis and reconnaissance. (Working on it, not out yet)

🧠 Key Skills

- Social engineering (ethical): scenario design, controlled human‑factor simulations, phishing research.

- Fraud detection & analysis: pattern identification, log analysis, investigation workflows.

- Development & infra: Python, Flask, Docker labs, basic CI.

- Tools: Burp, Nmap, Wireshark, Kali, Git, VSCode.
